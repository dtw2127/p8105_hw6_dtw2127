Load birth weight data and convert variables to factors where appropriate. 

```{r}
birthweight = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    babysex = fct_recode(babysex, "male" = "1", "female" = "2"),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    frace = fct_recode(frace, "white" = "1", "black" = "2", "asian" = "3", 
                       "puerto rican" = "4", "other" = "8"),
    malform = as.logical(malform),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace),
    mrace = fct_recode(mrace, "white" = "1", "black" = "2", "asian" = "3", 
                       "puerto rican" = "4"))
